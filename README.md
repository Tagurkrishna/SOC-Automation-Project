Welcome to the SOC Automation Project.

The goal here is to start from nothing to a fully integrated SOAR solution incorporating Wazuh & TheHive for case management. The sky is the limit when it comes to automation and it is up to your creativity.

# SOC Automation Project (Home Lab)

<small>

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of automated Security Operations Center (SOC) processes using a home lab environment. The aim is to integrate and automate various security tools and techniques to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.

## Environment Setup
- **Virtualized Infrastructure:** Setting up virtual machines using tools like VMware or VirtualBox.
- **Network Configuration:** Creating a simulated network environment to mimic real-world scenarios.
- **Security Tools Installation:** Deploying security tools such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions.

## Data Collection
- **Log Aggregation:** Collecting logs from different sources including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoints.
- **Data Normalization:** Ensuring logs are in a consistent format for efficient analysis.

## Alerting and Response
- **Automated Alerts:** Configuring alerting rules in the SIEM to detect suspicious activities.
- **Response Automation:** Writing custom scripts to automate response actions such as isolating compromised systems or notifying the security team.

## Dashboard Creation
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Developing dashboards in Kibana to visualize security events and incidents.
- **Incident Analysis:** Providing insights and analytics to help understand and mitigate threats.

## Automation Workflows
- **Shuffle:** Automating workflows and integrating tools.
- **Integrated Results:** Combining data from various sources for comprehensive analysis.
- **VirusTotal Integration:** Injecting results into VirusTotal for threat intelligence.
- **Fully Integrated SOAR Solution:** Incorporating Wazuh & TheHive for case management.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**
- **SIEM Solutions**
- **Python/Bash Scripts for Automation**
- **Network Simulation Tools**

## Objectives
- **Improve Incident Detection and Response Time:** Leveraging automation to quickly identify and respond to security incidents.
- **Enhance SOC Efficiency:** Reducing manual effort by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Scalable and Flexible Solution:** Building a lab environment that can be easily scaled and modified to test different scenarios.

## Key Features
- End-to-end SOC automation from log collection to incident response.
- Customizable dashboards for real-time security monitoring.
- Integration of multiple security tools to provide a comprehensive defense mechanism.
